**What would you do differently?**

**What was the most difficult part for you?** I had (and continue to have) a bit of trouble navigating the dizzying array of models spelled out in sections 6 and 7 of the `caret` package documentation (https://topepo.github.io/caret/available-models.html and https://topepo.github.io/caret/train-models-by-tag.html, repectively).  My troubles stem from the fact that (1) I have an extreme lack-of-knowledge about the vast majority of the models listed here available for use; (2) said lack-of-knowledge remains even after doing countless internet searches for countless numbers of models/methods (there were a handful of instances that didn't seem to show up when scouring the interent (at least not by the name listed in the `caret` documentation), and even those that did, more often than not, my head was left spinning after reading those pages that *did* come up on the topic); and (3) as a result, I am flying blind in terms of what tuning parameters to use, and/or how to explain a method/model that I don't even really understand myself.

**What are your big take-aways from this project?**
