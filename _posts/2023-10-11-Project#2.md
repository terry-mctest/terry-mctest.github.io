## Project #2 (10/11/2023)

**Explanation of what I did on the project**:  I switched the order of the first couple steps relative to what was laid out in the project2.pdf document; more specifically, as opposed to setting up a GitHub repository and getting RStudio connected to that repository, my first move was to search out an API to use and start developing code.  My rationale for doing so was, "oh, you don't know much about setting up GitHub repositories and getting RStudio connected, and so instead of risking spinning your wheels right off the bat, why don't you instead make moves where you have better odds of making at least some progress from the starting gate".  Best laid plans, huh?!  I ended up spinning my wheels for hours and hours and hours and hours on end clicking around for an API that seemed to satisfy all of the following: I could figure out how to access it; I could figure out how to parse it; I could understand the documentation / data that I was looking at; AND it seemed like it was comprised of data that would adequately support the EDA portion of the project.  Ugh, very frustrating.  I eventually ended up finding something that I was after (i.e. an API with data other than real-time data only) in the form of a Carbon Intensity API for Great Britain.  After doing so, I started developing code in an R script, after which I set up the GitHub repository, and connected an R project with an Rmd file, to which I started tranferring my code, and then fleshing out with a narrative.

**Interesting findings**:  To me, the most interesting finding is variation in electricity sources across the different regions in Great Britain.
