**What do you think being a data scientist is about?**  
In very broad terms, I'd say being a data scientist is about facilitating the use of data to inform decision-making.

**What do you see as the major duties and/or knowledge areas?**  
Harvesting data and preparing data for analysis; performing statistical analyses; distilling data and analytic results; drawing conclusions.

**What differences/similarities do you see between data scientists and statisticians?**  
The distinction between the two (data scientists vs. statisticians) is still a bit fuzzy to me, but I get the sense that, relative to statisticians, data scientists may be a bit more involved in pre-analysis activities (e.g. data harvesting, data cleaning, and data re-structuring) and may be a bit more "techy" (e.g. they may know more programming languages; they may be proficient with a wider array of apps/tools/platforms; they may be more likely to employ automation or machine learning), while statisticians may be more likely to employ advanced modelling techniques and/or more likely to address research questions that are more "pure science" in nature (e.g. "the process that underlies ABC appears to be one in which X influences Y, which then mediates Z").  That being said, it seems that similarities abound between the two; namely, both are using data, both are harnessing the power of computers, both are performing statistical analyses, and both are using combinations thereof to answer questions of interest.

**How do you view yourself in relation to these two areas?**  
I would consider myself neither a full-fledged data scientist nor a full-fledged statistician, but am hoping to gain skills in either/both arenas!
