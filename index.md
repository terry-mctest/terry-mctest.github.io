Hey there, my Fine Feathered Friends! (thats _"FFF"_ for those in the know)  Terry McTest here, and I'm a self-proclaimed **Big Bad Blogger (BBB)**.  Thats like a *Blogger Extraordinaire*, only better.  I love all things tech-y and computerweb-y, and if theres a way to get some `good ole fashioned code` up in this piece, well lets just say, I'm all for it.  As a dear friend of mine used to tell me,  
>It's all just typing!  

So, lets not stress ourselves about this for one lil ole second.  Now don't ask me why, but I have a sneaking suspicion that maybe you need to see something... maybe you need to see... a picture?!  Yeah, a picture!  
>You shall see things, wonderful to tell.

You mean like...  a cow?  On the roof of a cotton house?!  No, actually I mean like this silly ole dog, wearing some silly ole shades:
