## (another bloggy creation by Terry McTest)  

Hey there, my Fine Feathered Friends! (thats _"FFF"_ for those in the know)  M'names Terry McTest, and I'm a self-proclaimed **blogger extraordinaire**.  I love all things tech-y and computerweb-y, and if theres a way to get some good ole fashioned `code` up in this piece, well lets just say, I am all for it!  As a good friend of mine used to tell me,  
>It's all just typing!  

So lets not stress ourselves for one lil ole second.
